			you can attack ANY tile(as long as you can settle there if you win) you want.Even if the path to your target tile doesn't make sense.
		</p>
	<li>
		<p>
			Always scout the tile you want to attack , before you attack. Scouting an enemy tile after selecting troops gives you the probability of winning
			an attack on that tile.Basically keep your win probability >50% otherwise the mini-game would be made harder for you.On the other hand if you
			attack with win probability >90% you would progressively get easier experience in the mini-game as the probabilty increases over 90% and exact 
			opposite when win probability is below 50%

		<p>
			the amount of troops you lose in an attack is the percentage of health of your sprite at the end of the attack mini-game so quality of play counts!
			you play as : <br>
			<ul>
				<li>archer - if you have selected stealth troop in research or haven't upgraded your troops at all</li>
				<li>swordsman - if you have selected warrior troops in research</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			Bored of the attack mini game or is it too hard? You could use the sim_attack option so your attack result would be calculated based on your 
			win probability and the losses will be based on your research and win probability.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each tile has a contribution to your resource regeneration.So if you lose a tile you lose the regen contribution from that tile and 10% of your resrouces 
			as plunder to the attacker.
