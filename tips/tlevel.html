	 TROOP LEVEL AND FORTIFICATION
</h1>

<ul type="i">
	<li>
		<p>
			level 2 troops are twice as effective as level 1 troops (if you have just specialised your troops to stealth or warrior your troops are still level 1 !)
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			level 3 troops are thice as effective as level 1 troops
		</p>
	<li>
		<p>
			level 4 troops are 4X as effective as level 1 troops. and well you see where it's going right upto level 8
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			before attacking all troops are normalised to level 1 from the above pattern
		</p> 
	<li>
		<p>
			A level 2 fortified settlement will halve ( or make 1/2 of) the normalised soldiers
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A level 3 fortified settlement will make 1/3 of the normalised soldiers
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A level 4 fortified settlement will make 1/4 the normalised soldiers
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			A level 5 fortified settlement will make 1/5 the normalised soldiers
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			So attacking a settlement with fortification of 1 with 20 ,level 1 troops is mundane
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Attacking a settlement with fortifification of 1 with 20 ,level 2 troops is like 
			using 40 level 2 troops on the settlement  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Attacking a settlement with fortifification of 2 with 20 ,level 2 troops is like 
			using 20 level 2 troops on the settlement.again mundane  
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
			the LESSON LEARNT  -  THIS SHIT IS COMPLICATED!
			<ul>
				<li>So just select your soliers then scout the tile you want to attack before you attack</li>
				<li>increase fortification to make it harder to conquered by an enemy</li>
				<li>increase troop level to make it easier for you to conquer your enemy's tiles</li>
				<li><p>Research defence perk so the soldiers stationed at your settled tiles become more effective at defending your settlements
					your troop level won't count when the troops are defending</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
	</li>
