So long, so long, so long...
And thanks for all the fiiiiiiisshhh!

Thanks to everyone for working on with me on this, it has been a blast. I will forever remember the time we spent working like mad to make the game concept a reality.
I still remember Rudra's bewildered/skeptical expression when we suggested the idea. Normally I would rather keep a conservative estimate of our coding abilities and speed. This time however, I decided to throw caution to the wind and said we should just go with it, and I don't think I will ever regret doing that :P
Sid, Nish, Mitesh, Queeny & Caroline. You people are amazing! I don't think surpassing this time's mega event will be easy :P
